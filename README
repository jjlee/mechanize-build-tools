Support code for making releases and website maintenance

Probably of no use to anybody but me.

This provides the support code used by mechanize/release.py (from
http://github.com/jjlee/mechanize).  That script expects all of the
top-level directories to be on sys.path:

top=/path/to/mechanize-build-tools
pythonpath="$top"/src:"$top"/in-chroot:"$top"/plash-build-tools
if [ -n "$PYTHONPATH" ]
  then
    export PYTHONPATH="$pythonpath":"$PYTHONPATH"
  else
    export PYTHONPATH="$pythonpath"
fi
